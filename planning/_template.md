## Plan
<!-- PLAN PENDING — /scope fills this section. While this marker is present the item
is UNPLANNED and /build MUST refuse it. Delete this comment when the plan is complete. -->

_Write a complete, self-contained design here — enough that a fresh session can
`/build` it cold, without re-deriving anything. Fill every subsection._

### Goal
[One sentence.]

### Context — what exists
[The recon a builder would otherwise redo: relevant files with paths and
`file:line` refs, current behavior, key snippets, helpers/patterns to reuse.]

### Changes — what to do
1. `path` — [exact change and why]
2. `path` — [...]

### Design decisions
- [decision] — [rationale; alternatives rejected]

### Edge cases & risks
- [case] — [how it's handled]

### Tests
- [scenario] -> `test file`   (for a bug: the regression test to add)

### Docs
- `doc` — [what changes]

### Open questions
- [blocking unknowns, or "none"]

## Notes
[Scratch space — anything not part of the plan.]

## Resolution
- closed: YYYY-MM-DD
- branch:
- files changed:
- tests added:
