MOJO is a lightweight, modern ES6 JavaScript UI framework built on Bootstrap 5. It follows MVC architecture patterns with clean folder structures, RESTful API integration, and component-based development with advanced table, form, and dashboard capabilities.

We are using Vite
Examples should always be minimal code that relies on the framework's core features.  The goal is the examples are as simple as possible, and clean.

To run the framework, use the following command:
```
npm run dev
```

Keep all files organized and don't pollute the root directory.
Our framework is located in src
Our tests are located in tests
Our examples are located in examples

Always look to see if the logic already exists before writing new code.
Try to make the framework as robust as possible.
Try to make the framework as module, clean, and easy to use.
