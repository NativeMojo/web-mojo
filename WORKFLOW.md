# The Planning Workflow — Map & Setup Guide

A single, file-driven pipeline for AI-assisted development: every piece of work
flows **`request → scope → build → done`**, one item at a time, with the folder
an item lives in *being* its status. This document is two things:

1. **An explainer** — how the workflow works, for anyone new to the repo.
2. **A setup guide** — a complete manifest of every file the workflow uses, and
   how to drop the same system into another project.

For the day-to-day command reference see [`AI_DEV.md`](AI_DEV.md); for project
coding conventions see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). This file is the *architecture
+ portability* view that ties them together.

---

## 1. The mental model (four rules)

1. **One kind of work item.** Bugs, features, and chores are the *same* thing —
   a markdown file with a `type:` field. No separate folders, templates, or
   counters per type.
2. **The folder is the stage.** An item's directory *is* its status. It advances
   only by moving folders — and only the helper scripts move it.

   ```
   inbox/  →  confirmed/  →  in_progress/  →  done/
   (raw)      (scoped)       (building)        (closed)
   ```
3. **One ID space.** Every item gets `WM-###`, allocated exactly once by
   `scripts/intake.sh`. Never hand-assigned, never reused. The prefix (`WM`)
   comes from `planning/.config`.
4. **Scope before build.** Nothing is built until it carries a self-contained
   `## Plan`. The absence of the `PLAN PENDING` marker *is* the "designed"
   signal — there is no status field.

---

## 2. The chain

Each phase is ideally its own fresh Claude session; the **item file carries all
context between them**, so a build session starts clean.

```
  new work
    │
    ▼
  /request  "<what you want / what's broken>"
    │   • classifies type (bug|feature|chore), explores/clarifies
    │   • writes an un-ID'd item to  planning/inbox/<slug>.md
    ▼
  /scope  <inbox item>
    │   • scripts/intake.sh → allocates WM-###, stamps frontmatter,
    │       moves inbox/ → confirmed/, bumps planning/.next_id
    │   • writes a self-contained ## Plan, deletes the PLAN PENDING marker
    │   • gate: explicit user sign-off before the session ends
    ▼
  /build  <confirmed item | WM-###>
    │   • pre-flight: scripts/ready.sh (depends_on satisfied?) + not UNPLANNED
    │   • scripts/start.sh → claims confirmed/ → in_progress/ (WIP = 1)
    │   • establishes a GREEN test baseline, then implements
    │       (a failing regression test FIRST, for bugs)
    │   • runs tests, updates docs + examples portal, commits (no push)
    │   • spawns 3 post-build agents in parallel:
    │       test-runner · docs-updater · security-review
    │   • scripts/close.sh → stamps ## Resolution, moves in_progress/ → done/
    ▼
  done/  — the file now tells the whole story: intake → plan → resolution
```

Two side-folders sit outside the main line — **`future/`** (parked ideas) and
**`rejected/`** (declined, kept for the rationale). They're plain folders; no ID
is allocated. `scripts/close.sh <file> future|rejected` moves an item there;
move it back to `inbox/` by hand to revive it.

---

## 3. Everyday commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/board.sh` | The pipeline at a glance — one cheap line per item (`id · stage · type · priority · state · title`). Only the output costs tokens, not the files it scans. `board.sh confirmed` / `board.sh future` filters to a stage. |
| `/request <desc>` | Chat front door. Captures new work as an un-ID'd `inbox/` item. Determines the type itself. |
| `/scope <item>` | Intake + triage + planning. Allocates the ID and writes the `## Plan`. |
| `/build <item>` | Implements a scoped item end-to-end: claim → baseline → code + tests → commit → post-build agents → close. |
| `/memory` | Shows Claude Code's local project memory (read-only). |

On the board, a `confirmed/` item shows `UNPLANNED` (intook but no plan yet — a
`/build` will refuse it), `ready`, or `BLOCKED` (a `depends_on` isn't in
`done/`); an `in_progress/` item shows `wip`.

---

## 4. Complete file manifest

Everything the workflow touches, grouped. The **Portability** column is the
key for §6:

- ✅ **copy as-is** — generic machinery, works unchanged in any repo
- ✏️ **copy + edit** — reusable shape, but has project-specific values to change
- 🔧 **rewrite** — encodes *this* project's stack/conventions; keep the file, replace the content

### Skills — `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (invoked as `/<name>`)

| File | Purpose | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/request/SKILL.md` | Turn a chat ask into one structured `inbox/` item; classify `type`; explore/clarify. Does **not** allocate an ID or implement. | ✏️ |
| `skills/scope/SKILL.md` | Own intake (`intake.sh`), triage/pushback, tiered scoping (cheap drafter + first-hand verification), write the self-contained `## Plan`, stamp build routing. Gates on user sign-off. | ✏️ |
| `skills/build/SKILL.md` | Claim (`start.sh`), green baseline, implement one task at a time with tests; commit; spawn post-build agents; close. | ✏️ |
| `skills/memory/SKILL.md` | Display Claude Code's local project memory. | ✏️ |

> Skills embed a few project commands (`npm test` / `npm run test:unit`, the
> `docs/web-mojo/` doc track, `examples/portal/` + `npm run examples:registry`).
> The *workflow logic* is generic; edit those embedded commands per project.

### Rules — `.claude/rules/*.md` (loaded automatically, never invoked)

Rules with a `globs:` frontmatter line load only when Claude edits a matching
path; the rest are always active.

| File | Scope | Covers | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rules/core.md` | always | philosophy, `@core`/`@ext` imports, `this.model`, forbidden actions, delivery checklist | 🔧 |
| `rules/git.md` | always | **No branches/worktrees without permission** (the planning state lives in this tree → no parallel checkouts); commit-on-finish by explicit pathspec; never push | ✏️ |
| `rules/build-baseline.md` | always | Capture a **green test baseline before the first edit** so every later failure is attributable | ✏️ |
| `rules/docs.md` | always | Where docs live, when to update, `CHANGELOG.md`, quick lookup | 🔧 |
| `rules/views.md` | `src/core/{views,forms,pages}/`, `src/extensions/` | View/Page lifecycle, data binding, actions/containers, templates | 🔧 |
| `rules/api.md` | `src/core/{Rest,Model,Collection}.js`, `src/core/models/` | Models, Collections, REST conventions, response nesting | 🔧 |
| `rules/testing.md` | `test/` | custom test runner, commands, mocks/matchers, regression rules, Chrome UI | 🔧 |
| `rules/theming.md` | views/extensions/css | light/dark theme conventions (Bootstrap tokens over hex) | 🔧 |

### Agents — `.claude/agents/*.md` (spawned automatically by `/build` after commit)

Each runs in its own isolated context window.

| File | Model | Purpose | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agents/test-runner.md` | sonnet | Run the full suite; fix trivial errors (syntax/imports); report complex failures without fixing | ✏️ |
| `agents/docs-updater.md` | sonnet | Read the git diff; update `docs/web-mojo/` + `CHANGELOG.md`; flag missing portal examples | 🔧 |
| `agents/security-review.md` | opus | Review the diff for permission gaps, data exposure, escaping/injection, auth issues | ✏️ |

### Scripts — `scripts/*.sh` (the deterministic, must-be-exact machinery)

Portable across macOS (BSD) and Linux (GNU). **All ✅ — they're driven entirely
by `planning/.config`, so they need no editing.** (This repo's `scripts/` also
holds unrelated Node build tooling — the workflow owns only the five `.sh`.)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/intake.sh` | Allocate the next ID, stamp frontmatter, move `inbox/ → confirmed/`, bump the counter — atomically. Refuses to consume a number if the item already has an `id`; reconciles against the tree so a stale counter can't duplicate. |
| `scripts/start.sh` | Claim a planned item: `confirmed/ → in_progress/`. Idempotent "resume"; enforces **WIP = 1**; refuses an `UNPLANNED` item. |
| `scripts/ready.sh` | Dependency gate — `READY` (exit 0) / `BLOCKED` (exit 1) by checking each `depends_on` is in `done/`. Handles cross-repo deps (`repo#ID`) as manual-verify notes. |
| `scripts/close.sh` | Route an item to a terminal folder. `done` (default) stamps the `## Resolution` block (closed date, branch, changed files from git) and moves to `done/`; `future`/`rejected` are plain moves. |
| `scripts/board.sh` | Render the pipeline table from frontmatter. |

### Planning tree — `planning/`

| Path | Purpose | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `planning/.config` | Shell-sourced config. Sets `PREFIX=WM` (the item-ID prefix). | ✏️ (set your prefix) |
| `planning/.next_id` | Single bare integer — the next item number. | ✏️ (reset to `1`) |
| `planning/_template.md` | The one item template (YAML frontmatter + section skeleton, incl. the `## Plan` scaffold + `PLAN PENDING` marker). | ✅ |
| `planning/inbox/` | New, unscoped items (no ID yet). | ✅ (empty dir) |
| `planning/confirmed/` | Scoped + planned items (have ID + `## Plan`). | ✅ (empty dir) |
| `planning/in_progress/` | Actively being built (WIP = 1). | ✅ (empty dir) |
| `planning/done/` | Closed items — the project's decision history. | ✅ (empty dir) |
| `planning/future/` | Parked ideas. | ✅ (empty dir) |
| `planning/rejected/` | Declined items, kept for rationale. | ✅ (empty dir) |
| `planning/mockups/` | *(this repo)* HTML/UI sketches, one folder per component — approval gate for UI-heavy items. | — (optional) |
| `planning/notes/` | *(this repo)* audits and longer-form planning notes — reference, not work items. | — (optional) |

### Root docs & config

| Path | Purpose | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Auto-loaded project instructions: conventions, trust order, the "start every thread here" checklist. | 🔧 |
| `AI_DEV.md` | The command-reference companion to this file. | ✏️ |
| `WORKFLOW.md` | *This file* — architecture map + setup guide. | ✏️ |
| `memory.md` | Committed **working memory** — non-obvious decisions & watch-list, read at the top of every thread. Starts nearly empty. | ✅ (empty scaffold) |
| `.claude/rules/testing.md` | The full test workflow (this repo keeps it as a scoped rule rather than a root `TESTING.md`). | 🔧 |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | **Local only (gitignored)** — per-machine permissions/config. Not part of the portable scaffold. | — |

> **Two memories, don't confuse them.** `memory.md` (above) is committed and
> shared. `/memory` shows Claude Code's *separate* per-user local memory (under
> `~/.claude/projects/…`), which is not a repo file and doesn't travel with a
> clone.

---

## 5. Item file format & lifecycle

Every item starts from `planning/_template.md` and grows section-by-section, so
a finished `done/` file reads as the complete story: intake → plan → resolution.

**Frontmatter** (YAML, first block):

```yaml
---
id: WM-014             # allocated by intake.sh; never hand-set or reused
type: bug              # feature | bug | chore
title: Short imperative title
priority: P2           # P0 (drop everything) | P1 | P2 | P3
effort: M              # XS | S | M | L | XL
owner: frontend
opened: 2026-06-05     # ISO date
depends_on: []         # hard blockers: [WM-003, nativemojo/django-mojo#DM-007]
related: []            # soft links
links: []              # external URLs
build_strategy: inline # optional — inline | delegate | fanout (stamped by /scope)
build_model: sonnet    # optional — sonnet | opus | fable
---
```

**Sections, added by phase:**

| Phase | Added by | Sections |
|---|---|---|
| Intake | `/request` | `## What & Why`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, `## Repro` (bugs) |
| Plan | `/scope` | `## Plan` (Goal · Context · Changes · Design decisions · Edge cases · Tests · Docs · Open questions), and the `PLAN PENDING` marker is **deleted** |
| Resolution | `/build` → `close.sh` | `## Resolution` (closed date · branch · files changed · tests added) |

The `PLAN PENDING` HTML comment is the gate: while it's present the item is
`UNPLANNED` and `scripts/start.sh` / `/build` refuse it.

---

## 6. Setting this up in a new project

The workflow is deliberately layered so the **machinery is generic** and only a
thin edge is project-specific.

### Copy verbatim (✅)

```
scripts/*.sh                # all five — driven by .config, no edits
planning/_template.md
planning/{inbox,confirmed,in_progress,done,future,rejected}/   # empty dirs
```

(Git doesn't track empty dirs — drop a `.gitkeep` in each, or let the first
item create it.)

### Create fresh (✏️)

```
planning/.config    →  PREFIX=<YOURPREFIX>     # e.g. WM, DM, HB — the ID prefix
planning/.next_id   →  1                        # start the counter
memory.md           →  empty "Working Memory" scaffold (Key Decisions / Watch List)
```

### Copy then adapt (✏️ / 🔧)

1. **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — copy all four, then find-and-replace the
   embedded project commands:
   - the test commands (here `npm test` / `npm run test:unit` + the custom
     runner's terminal summary),
   - the docs step (here `docs/web-mojo/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the
     `examples/portal/` + `npm run examples:registry` example rule).
2. **Rules** (`.claude/rules/`) — keep the *file set and the always/scoped
   split*, but rewrite the content for your stack. Portable in spirit:
   `git.md` (no unauthorized branches; the planning-state-lives-in-tree reason),
   and `build-baseline.md` (green-before-you-start). Fully project-specific:
   `core.md`, `views.md`, `api.md`, `testing.md`, `theming.md`, `docs.md`.
   Point each scoped rule's `globs:` at your source layout.
3. **Agents** (`.claude/agents/`) — copy the three post-build agents; edit their
   instructions to name your doc tracks and test command. Pick models to taste.
4. **`CLAUDE.md`** — write your project instructions. Include a "Planning"
   section describing this pipeline and a "start every thread here" checklist
   (read `CLAUDE.md` → read `memory.md` → run `scripts/board.sh` → pick a mode).
5. **`AI_DEV.md`** — adapt the command reference (mostly prefix/command swaps).

### Bootstrap checklist

- [ ] `scripts/` copied; `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
- [ ] `planning/` dirs created; `.config` prefix set; `.next_id` = `1`
- [ ] `planning/_template.md` copied
- [ ] `.claude/skills/` copied + project commands swapped
- [ ] `.claude/rules/` written for your stack (globs pointed at your tree)
- [ ] `.claude/agents/` copied + doc tracks / test command adjusted
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` written (conventions + planning section + thread checklist)
- [ ] `memory.md` empty scaffold committed
- [ ] Smoke test: `/request` a trivial chore → `/scope` it → confirm `WM-001`
      (or your prefix) lands in `confirmed/` with a plan → `scripts/board.sh`
      shows it → `/build` it → it lands in `done/`

### What makes it portable

The scripts never hard-code the prefix, paths, or item count — they read
`planning/.config` and reconcile IDs against the actual tree. Everything
project-specific is either in `.config` (the prefix) or in prose the model reads
(skills, rules, agents, `CLAUDE.md`). Swap that thin edge and the same
deterministic pipeline runs anywhere.

---

## 7. Invariants & gotchas (cheat-sheet)

- **WIP = 1.** At most one item in `in_progress/`. `start.sh` refuses a second.
- **One test runner per build.** The baseline comparison is only meaningful when
  one entity's edits are the only variable — the session (inline), the delegate,
  or the fanout orchestrator runs the suite; parallel builders never do.
- **No branches/worktrees without explicit permission** — the planning pipeline
  (stage folders, `.next_id`, the WIP claim) lives in this working tree; a second
  checkout forks it. Work in place on `main`.
- **Green baseline before the first edit.** Capture it, record it in the item;
  then every new failure is unambiguously yours.
- **IDs are allocated once, by `intake.sh`, never reused** — even if the counter
  is stale or an item was merged back, it reconciles against the tree.
- **`PLAN PENDING` is the build gate** — an intook-but-unplanned item is refused
  until `/scope` finishes the plan and deletes the marker.
- **Advance only via the scripts** — never hand-move a file between planning
  folders (you'd skip ID allocation, the WIP check, or the Resolution stamp).
- **Commit by explicit pathspec** — stage named files, never `git add -A`; the
  planning tree often carries unrelated in-flight items.
